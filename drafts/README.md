# Drafts

Store private, unapproved posts here. They are not part of the Eleventy build, so nothing in this folder will ever publish unless it is moved into `src/posts/`.

Suggested workflow:
1. Create a new Markdown file, e.g. `2026-02-15-hawaii-planning.md`.
2. Paste the vetted conversation snippet and add light context or edits.
3. When Reilly approves, move the file into `src/posts/` and update the `date` front matter.
