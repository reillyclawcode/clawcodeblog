  <h3>The playbook exists. The question is execution.</h3>
  <p>StrategyOS ranks personal, organizational, and policy strategies by real-world impact — and connects each action to the specific metrics it moves across ClimateOS, TransitionOS, GovernanceOS, and the rest of the ecosystem. This is the "so what?" that makes everything actionable.</p>

## The gap between knowing and doing

We've built dashboards that show where we stand ([ClimateOS](https://climate-os.vercel.app/)), where the workforce is headed ([TransitionOS](https://transition-os-beta.vercel.app/)), how governance is performing ([GovernanceOS](https://civilization-os-ashy.vercel.app/)), and what the aggregate picture looks like ([CivilizationOS](https://civilization-os-3nlf.vercel.app/)). The [Simulation](https://simulation-brown.vercel.app/) runs the macro model. Scorecard grades tell you the current state and scenario projections show possible futures.

But none of that answers the most important question: **what can I actually do about it?**

StrategyOS fills that gap.

## What's in StrategyOS

### Overview — Strategy Readiness Score

Just like ClimateOS has a Climate Score and CivilizationOS has a Health Index, StrategyOS has a **Strategy Readiness Score** — a composite grade measuring how prepared we are to execute across six domains: Climate Action, Economic Transition, Governance Quality, Social Equity, Individual Agency, and Systemic Readiness.

Four scenarios (Aggressive Action, Moderate Adoption, Business as Usual, Active Regression) drive every visualization. The overview includes aggregate charts for emissions, temperature, biodiversity, and equity — each with scenario-aware descriptive paragraphs explaining what the trajectory means.

### Personal Actions — 25 strategies ranked by impact

Every action most people hear about is noise. Skipping a plastic straw saves 1.5g of CO₂. Switching your energy provider saves 1,800 kg. Voting for candidates with credible climate plans can move gigatons.

StrategyOS ranks 25 personal strategies across 8 categories (Energy, Food, Transport, Finance, Waste, Civic, Career, Social) by actual impact — not by how virtuous they feel. Each card shows CO₂ savings, cost, difficulty, and which ecosystem metrics it moves.

The highest-impact personal action? **Civic engagement and voting** (impact score: 95). Policy is the multiplier.

### Organization Strategies — systemic leverage

A single company setting science-based targets moves more carbon than a thousand individuals changing light bulbs. StrategyOS ranks 8 organizational strategies from Supply Chain Decarbonization (95) to Remote Work Policy (60), each connected to the ecosystem dashboard it influences.

### Policy Interventions — 31 levers across 11 categories

This is the most comprehensive section. Policy is where individual intention meets systemic scale:

- **Economic Instruments** — Carbon pricing, fossil fuel subsidy reform, green procurement, climate financial regulation
- **Energy Policy** — Clean electricity standards, grid modernization, nuclear, distributed energy
- **Transport & Infrastructure** — Vehicle electrification, public transit, urban planning, freight decarbonization
- **Buildings & Land Use** — Net-zero building codes, appliance standards, deforestation prevention
- **Emissions Regulation** — Methane, industrial emissions, F-gas phase-down
- **Biodiversity & Nature** — Nature-based solutions, ocean protection, regenerative agriculture, plastics treaty
- **Workforce & Social** — Universal transition programs, climate education, basic services, migration planning
- **Governance & Institutions** — AI governance, anti-corruption, citizen assemblies, international cooperation
- **Technology & Innovation** — Clean energy R&D, carbon removal procurement, open data commons
- **Food & Agriculture** — Subsidy reform, food waste regulation, sustainable protein transition
- **Health & Environment** — Air quality standards, climate-health integration, environmental justice

Each intervention is ranked by impact score, with cost estimates, difficulty ratings, CO₂ reduction potential, and the specific metrics it moves across the ecosystem.

### Impact Simulator — "What if everyone did this?"

Select any combination of 10 major strategies and see the aggregate CO₂ reduction in real time. A progress ring shows what percentage of global emissions (52 Gt/yr) your selection addresses. The narrative adapts: under 10 Gt is "a start," over 30 Gt is "transformative."

Select everything and you cut ~45 Gt — roughly 87% of global emissions. The strategies exist. The question is deployment.

## What's next

StrategyOS is the bridge between understanding and action. Next steps:

- **Link deepening** — clicking a strategy card takes you to the specific metric it moves in the relevant dashboard
- **Personalization** — save your action plan, track what you've implemented
- **Community strategies** — crowdsourced local actions that don't fit global categories
- **Cost-benefit calculator** — model the financial return on personal and organizational strategies

The playbook is written. The dashboards show the score. StrategyOS shows what to do about it.
