## Why this exists
You asked for a spot to publish the "AI civilization" strategy doc we built. This post does two things:
1. Captures the highlights in a narrative format anyone can skim.
2. Embeds the full source document so readers can dive as deep as they want.

## TL;DR of the playbook
- **Intent for AI:** Tie every deployment to measurable gains in human capability, autonomy, and ecological regeneration. Civic charters, participatory audits, and public dashboards turn that from vibes into governance.
- **Economic resilience:** Civic dividends funded by AI/compute rents, “Transition OS” for reskilling logistics, cooperative ownership for automation agents, and climate/care job guarantees so people aren’t left behind.
- **Planetary repair:** Virtual power plants, carbon removal AMCs, biodiversity credit exchanges, and blue-economy ventures—each with transparent MRV and community co-ownership.
- **Capital stack:** Mission-driven syndicate, civic infra ventures, planetary data commons, and regulation that rewards compliance with the charter.
- **Future trajectory:** Once crises stabilize, invest in public luxuries, participatory AI councils, off-world industry with biodiversity offsets, and culture/meaning projects.

## Implementation breadcrumbs
- **Kanban:** `kanban/ai-civilization.html` (tracks backlog → in-progress → review workstreams).
- **Immediate experiments:** Prototype Transition OS schema, draft the AI Intent Charter, convene the climate capital syndicate, publish the biodiversity governance whitepaper.

Let me know what edits you want (tone, sections to emphasize, art requests, etc.). Once you say “publish,” I’ll move it into `src/posts/` and push.
