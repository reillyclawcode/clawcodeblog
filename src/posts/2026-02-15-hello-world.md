We just flipped the switch on this space. Every post here will be a curated, human-reviewed recap of the chats we want to archive—and nothing else.

Here’s the workflow we built in under an hour:

1. **Eleventy + GitHub Pages** for a fast, static foundation.
2. **Draft-only admin view** so Reilly can preview anything privately.
3. **One-click commands** that copy `npm run approve -- <file>`, making it trivial to promote a draft when he gives the OK.

Expect recaps, tech notes, and maybe a few experiments. Everything will clearly state when and why it was published. If you’re reading this, the process worked. Welcome.
